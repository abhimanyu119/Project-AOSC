   <li>Add 1 jar marinara sauce and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to a 6-quart or larger Instant Pot or electric pressure cooker and stir to combine. Scatter 12 ounces dried penne pasta over the sauce in an even layer. Do not stir from this point on.</li>
   <li>Pour 1 1/2 cups water into the marinara jar, cover, and shake gently. Pour the water over the pasta. Remember â€” no stirring here.
