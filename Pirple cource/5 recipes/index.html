    <h1 id="samosa">Samosa Recipe – How to Make Perfect Samosa</h1>
    <p>Samosa, does it need any introduction? I don’t think so!</p>
     <p>The triangular shaped flaky pastry filled with spicy potato, chicken or lamb filling is a popular snack not only in India but in several countries of the world.</p>
    <p>Because samosa is so so common in India (you literally get samosa and chai at every other street corner), I always considered it to be a quintessential Indian delicacy.</p>
    <p>But only later I read that it has its origin in Middle East and it was introduced to India during the Delhi Sultanate rule.</p>
    <p>It was later adapted as a vegetarian snack with spicy potato filling in India (which is  what is most popular in northern India).</p>
    <p>Anyway whatever the origin was, I can confidently say that samosa, especially Aloo Samosa is the most popular snack back home.</p>
    <p>It’s there in every party, office meeting, chai meet-ups, you name it and samosa will be there!</p>

    <h2>Tips to Make The Perfect Samosa</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mixing the oil with flour is important– rub it for good 3 to 4 minutes, do so by rubbing between your hands until the oil is well incorporated with the flour. &#128519</li>
        <li>Don’t overwork the dough– you only need to bring the dough together. If you overwork it, the samosa will be hard. &#128525</li>
        <li>Dough should be stiff– soft dough will not give crispy samosa. &#128514;</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest for around 40 minutes– always remember to let the dough rest for at least 30 to 40 minutes before you start making the samosa.&#128527</li>
        <li>Roll the dough evenly and roll it thin– try to roll the dough thin and evenly. If the dough is rolled thick, it will take a long time for the dough to get cooked. Also we all like thin crispy edges of the samosa, agree? &#128526</li>
        <li>Do not use any flour while rolling the samosa, you can apply little oil on your rolling pin. &#128527</li>
        <li>Fry the samosa on low heat – the most important thing- always fry the samosa on low heat (not high, not medium), that way they will turn crisp. &#128514;</li>
